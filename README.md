# azalert
Chrome extension to ping the user whenever they go to an amazon owned page - based on blockamazonforme

My intensions with this is to have the awareness of avoiding amazon subsidiaries and the like, but not negate its usefulness for browsing products to purchase elsewhere.

TODO:
- duplicate the identification part of https://github.com/blockamazonforme/blockamazonforme/
- ping/alert the user rather than replacing the page with something useless
- Stretch: alert the user when about to make a purchase on amazon (or subsidiaries, assuming similar design), to shop elsewhere (i.e. when in cart)
