# azalert
Chrome extension to ping the user whenever they go to an amazon owned page - based on blockamazonforme

Why?
My intention with this is to have the awareness of avoiding amazon subsidiaries and the like, but not negate its usefulness for browsing products to purchase elsewhere.
At the end of the day, the true reason this exists is because I want to use something like it, and at the time of writing, blockamazonforme isn't quite that.


TODO:
- duplicate the identification part of https://github.com/blockamazonforme/blockamazonforme/
- ping/alert the user rather than replacing the page with something useless
- Stretch: alert the user when about to make a purchase on amazon (or subsidiaries, assuming similar design), to shop elsewhere (i.e. when in cart)
